##### Before you begin

# Install dependencies: 

#pysam
#tabulate
#bedtools
#deeptools
#matplotlib
#pandas
#bwa
#pairtools
#samtools
#preseq
#python3
#pip3

# On Ubuntu/Linux system clone the git repository:
git clone https://github.com/dovetail-genomics/Micro-C.git
# Run installation script
./Micro-C/installDep.sh

# Once installation is complete close and reopen terminal

# Gather data sets: here are samples you can work from

## 2 fastq files R1 and R2 (fastq.gz is also acceptable
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/dovetail.pub/HiC/fastqs/MicroC_2M_R1.fastq
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/dovetail.pub/HiC/fastqs/MicroC_2M_R2.fastq
## We worked with sample data from Yong: find R1/R2 in microsoft teams

## Reference genome from UCSC: 
wget https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/hg38.fa.gz

##### Pre-Alignment: 

# Generate an index file for your reference (a reference file with only the main chromosomes should be used)
## Convert downloaded genome to the correct .fasta format
gunzip hg38.fa.gz
cp hg38.fa hg38.fasta
## Generate index file
samtools faidx hg38.fa.gz

# Use the index file to generate the genome file by printing the first two columns into a new file
cut -f1,2 hg38.fasta.fai > hg38.genome

# Prior to alignment, generate a bwa index file for the chosen reference genome
bwa index hg38.fasta

# Create a temporary directory to avoid running into memory issues in later steps
mkdir /home/user/ebs/temp
